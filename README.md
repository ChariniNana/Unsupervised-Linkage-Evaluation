# Unsupervised-Linkage-Evaluation
</div>

This repository contains the Python scripts and data used in our proposed Unsupervised Evaluation Methods for 
Entity Resolution.

These programs can be executed in a Python 3 environment.

## Datasets
We use six datasets in our experiments. For each dataset, we provide the pairwise similarities and the
ground truth, as well as the entity resolution (ER) clustering results obtained with three different
ER algorithms, for different clustering thresholds.

- /data/similarity_graphs_and_ground_truth/: Contains the pairwise similarity graph and ground truth files.

- /data/er_clusters/: Contains the ER clustering result files.

## Unsupervised evaluation methods
The Python implementation of the different unsupervised evaluation methods we have proposed are provided in
the /scripts/methods/ modules.
These programs can be run using the scripts in /scripts/run/
